### Project Description

This project involved the extraction, processing, and visualization of election data. Using Power BI, we created interactive reports that allow users to explore the dataset and gain insights into election trends. The data was initially sourced from the **Presidency UCSB Elections Database** and then cleaned and processed using **Python** to ensure its accuracy and readiness for analysis.

With the help of **Power BI**, the cleaned data was visualized in various formats, including bar charts, Pie Charts, and interactive maps, making it easy to identify patterns in the election results. The interactive report allows users to explore specific areas, compare different variables, and draw their own conclusions.

Figma was used for designing elements of the presentation and ensuring the visual appeal of the reports.
